1. Opening
Marcus Lindgren opened the meeting.

2. Purpose
The purpose of this extraordinary meeting is to discuss and approve
the engagement of Setterwalls Advokatbyrå to conduct a legal review
in preparation for a potential transaction process.

3. Transaction Readiness
Marcus Lindgren reported that the Company has received inbound interest
from multiple parties regarding a potential acquisition. The Board
discussed timing and process.

Lars Wennerström noted that NorthCap's fund has a 2025 exit horizon
and recommended proceeding with preparation.

4. Known Issues for Disclosure
The Board discussed items requiring disclosure:

  a) IP Dispute: Former developer Alexei Petrov (employed 2019-2021,
     Lithuania office) has claimed co-authorship of the SynCore
     transformation engine's parallel processing module. His lawyers
     sent a formal letter in June 2024. Setterwalls assesses the
     claim as "not without merit" but manageable.

  b) Revenue Recognition: CFO Johan Nylund flagged that 3 multi-year
     contracts signed in Q4 2023 include implementation services
     bundled with SaaS licenses. These have been recognized as SaaS
     revenue. Auditors were not specifically consulted on the
     bundling treatment.

  c) Lithuanian Employment: The Lithuania team operates as direct
     employees of DataSyn Nordic AB. No local entity exists. Tax
     counsel has advised this structure carries risk of permanent
     establishment classification.

5. Decisions
The Board resolved:
  - To engage Setterwalls for legal review (budget: 400 kSEK)
  - To instruct management to prepare a vendor due diligence report
  - To maintain strict confidentiality regarding the process

6. Closing
Meeting closed at 16:30.
