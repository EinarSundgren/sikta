## Environment Status

### Services

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `api` | Ready (local `go run` or `air`) | `make backend` |
| `web` | Ready (Vite dev server) | `make frontend` |
| `db` | Ready (podman container) | `make infra` — requires podman machine running |

### Tools Installed

| Tool | How to Install |
|------|---------------|
| `air` | `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest` |
| `sqlc` | `go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest` |
| `podman-compose` | `pip3 install podman-compose` |
| `pdftotext` | Install poppler-utils (system package manager) |

Add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to PATH for installed Go tools.

### Podman Notes

Podman machine must be running before `make infra`:
```
/opt/podman/bin/podman machine start
```

podman-compose binary is at `/Users/einar.sundgren/Library/Python/3.9/bin/podman-compose`.
Add to PATH: `export PATH="$PATH:/Users/einar.sundgren/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"`

### Database

**Migrations Applied:** 10 (001_documents through 010_rename_sources_claims)

**Schema Version:** 010_rename_sources_claims

**Current Data:** Pride and Prejudice (doc ID: `334903c6-de15-469a-8671-686dd9c2b534`) — 61 chunks, 178 events, 54 entities, 58 relationships

---

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Workaround |
|-------|----------|------------|
| podman-compose not in PATH by default | Low | Add `/Users/einar.sundgren/Library/Python/3.9/bin` to PATH |
| Go tools not in PATH by default | Low | Add `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` to PATH |
| pdftotext required for PDF parsing | Medium | Install poppler-utils via system package manager |
| `events_event_type_check` constraint too restrictive | Low | ~6 events lost from extraction when LLM returns unexpected types. Will be fixed in migration. |

---

## Next Milestone

**Milestone:** Post-MVP — Source Text Viewer & Cross-references (Phase 8)

**Why this is next:** MVP is complete. All 7 phases delivered. Phase 8 adds deep source traceability: click any event → see the exact passage it was extracted from.

**Recommended model:** Sonnet for implementation.

**Known issue:** `claim_entities` table is empty — the extraction pipeline stored events and entities separately but never linked them. Entity filtering on the timeline uses text-match fallback (works for Pride and Prejudice). To fix properly: update the extraction prompt to return participant entities per event, add `storeEvent` to call `CreateClaimEntity` for each participant.

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-19 | Rename `documents` → `sources`, `events` → `claims` | Sources is more accurate (any ingested material). Claims captures that extractions are assertions, not ground truth. Enables two-level confidence and claim_type discriminator for extensibility. |
| 2026-02-19 | Two-level confidence model | Source trust (how reliable is the source?) vs assertion confidence (how confident is the extraction?). Effective confidence = trust × confidence. |
| 2026-02-19 | `claim_type` discriminator | Single `claims` table holds events, attributes, and relational claims. New claim types = zero schema changes. |
| 2026-02-19 | Keep HTTP routes as `/api/documents/...` during migration | External API stability. Internal naming changes, external stays the same. |
| 2026-02-18 | Chapter-based chunking (not size-based) | Chapters are the smallest coherent narrative units. LLM extraction needs context. |
| 2026-02-18 | Multiple regex patterns for chapter detection | Handles different formatting styles (Roman numerals, numeric, "CHAPTER X", etc.) |
| 2026-02-18 | pdftotext for PDF parsing | Reliable, preserves layout, handles multi-column documents well |
| 2026-02-18 | Page marker strategy for PDFs | Insert `[[[PAGE N]]]` markers during extraction, build lookup table for offset→page mapping |
| 2026-02-18 | Async processing with worker pool | Prevent resource exhaustion, handle multiple concurrent uploads |
| 2026-02-18 | Repository pattern for database access | Clean separation of concerns, easy to test |
| 2026-02-18 | Pride and Prejudice as demo novel | Rich social network, manageable length, well-known, public domain. |
| 2026-02-18 | Horizontal dual-lane timeline as hero view | Chronological vs. narrative order displayed simultaneously. Crossed connectors reveal non-linear storytelling. |
| 2026-02-18 | Polished demo quality | This needs to impress as a shareable artifact. Not a prototype — a demo. |
| 2026-02-18 | Go + React + PostgreSQL stack | Consistent with portfolio (Substrata, Sundla). Boring technology principle. |
| 2026-02-18 | D3.js for timeline and graph | Dual-lane timeline with connectors is too custom for a charting library. Need full control. |
| 2026-02-18 | Go 1.22+ stdlib mux for routing | Method+path pattern routing added in Go 1.22. No external router needed for Phase 0-1. |
| 2026-02-18 | pgx/v5 as database driver | Matches sqlc.yaml sql_package config. Standard high-performance PostgreSQL driver. |
| 2026-02-18 | Vite proxy for /health and /api | Frontend calls backend via same-origin proxy — no CORS in dev, clean production parity. |
